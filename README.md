# Python Flask Test Suite
This repository contains a test suite for Python Flask applications. The test suite is designed to test various aspects of a Flask application, including views, models, and functionality. The test suite uses the pytest testing framework, which provides a simple and flexible way to write and run tests.

The test suite includes fixtures that can be used to set up a test environment, including a test client and a database connection. This makes it easy to write tests that interact with the Flask application and its components.

In addition to the test suite itself, this repository also includes a sample Flask application that can be used to demonstrate how the tests work. The sample application includes a few views and models, as well as some basic functionality.

## Installation
To install the test suite, clone the repository and install the dependencies using pip:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-flask-test-suite.git
    cd python-flask-test-suite
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
## Usage
To run the test suite, use the following command:

    pytest
    
This will run all the tests in the test suite. You can also specify a specific file or test to run with the command:
    
    pytest tests/test_views.py
